Autonomous Traffic Simulator
============================
Uses MPI to implement a parallelized traffic simulator. Can be run in two different modes:

1. Standard - Simulates regular traffic flow controlled by stoplights.
2. Autonomous - Simulates optimized traffic flow with autonomous vehicles that are able to communicate their intentions to the traffic controller at the intersection.
